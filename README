Sitemap Wayfinding Applescript Generator: SWAG README file

This is my first open source project, so be gentle. It's an AppleScript application that may be used with a sitemap.xml file and Omnigraffle Professional 5 (other versions may work, this is what I developed the script using).

I am open sourcing the software in the hopes that others make additions that make it useful.

Good luck! Contact me at http://blog.fuzzymath.com/ or jason@fuzzymath.com with questions or suggestions.
